//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

//making array
let sportsCars = ["Lamborghini","Ferrari","Supra MK","GTR","Buggatti","Land Cruiser","McLaren","Porsche","Audi R8","Bmw"];

//printing message
console.log("Here is a list of some sports cars:");

//printing list one by one, agr hum foreach nhi use kren  ge to wo list ki form mei nhi dega
sportsCars.forEach(cars=>console.log(cars));
