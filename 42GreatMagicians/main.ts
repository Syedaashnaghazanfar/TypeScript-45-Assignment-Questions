// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


let magiciansName = ["John","Harry","Frosar","Joseph"];

function make_great(magicians : string[]){
    for(let  i=0 ; i<magicians.length; i++){
       magiciansName[i] = " The Great " + magicians[i]
    }
}

function show_magicician( magicians: string[]){
    magicians.forEach(name=> console.log(name));
}

make_great(magiciansName);
show_magicician(magiciansName);
